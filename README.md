üõ†Ô∏è Approach & Workflow

1. Data Exploration & Understanding
   
Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and quality.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.

3. Data Preprocessing
   
Handle missing or inconsistent data points.
Parse datetime columns into separate features like year, month, day, hour, minute, etc.
Normalize and scale the data for optimal model performance.

5. Feature Engineering
   
Identify key features (e.g., day of the week, daily power averages, peak hours).
Create additional features like rolling averages or external factors (e.g., weather data) to improve model predictions.

7. Model Selection & Training
   
Split data into training and test sets.
Train several regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
Use hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV) to find the best model settings.

9. Model Evaluation & Selection
    
Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.
Compare the models and select the one that performs best based on the evaluation metrics.


üìà Evaluation Metrics

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures how well the model predicts energy consumption by calculating the square root of the average squared differences between actual and predicted values.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Indicates the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, without considering direction.

R-Squared (R¬≤): Shows the proportion of the variance in energy consumption that is explained by the model.

Feature Importance: Helps identify the most influential features driving energy consumption predictions.

Visualization Quality: Assesses how well data insights and model performance are communicated visually.
